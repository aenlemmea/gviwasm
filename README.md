## GVIWASM

[Learning Project, WIP]

A graph visualizer written in C++20 and compiled with WASM for web use. 

Notes: The tests are currently used for quick output verification and are not yet coveraging code, **yet**.

### TODO

[] Allow both Boost Graph Library (BGL) to be optionally used as a separate backend. (Maybe with dynamic lib loading?)
[] Use BGL backend to support GraphViz strings.
[] Allow coloring support.
[] [Low priority] Allow algorithms visualizations.
